# What is LiveChat
LiveChat is a highly personalized conversation app that is widely used in multiple scenarios. It can realize functions such as virtual star chasing, reappearance of deceased relatives and friends, emotional companionship and other functions.

In order to realize the personalized function, we start from the two aspects of interaction method and response quality. First of all, we provide as many different interaction methods as possible, such as touch interaction, voice interaction and text interaction with live2d images. In terms of response quality, we improve the quality of responses through the integration of multiple modules.
